I've been flirting about creating a blog for a long time, and I've documented why I finally decided to do so in this blog post.

# Knowledge sharing
The more experience I gain in my profession, the more I have the urge to synthesize and share my knowledge. Just improving myself and feeling competent in my daily job does not satisfy me enough anymore. I want to share most of the knowledge I've accumulated in the past years to help others and initiate discussions around my ideas.

# Communication
As a non-native speaker, I sometimes struggle with communicating in English effectively. Since English is the primary language in our profession, developing communication skills is vital, especially if one wants to become a leader. Effective communication is one of the most [needed skills](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/leadership-communication) in leadership positions.

# Learning
I love to read as much as I love to write, and I realized long ago that writing is one of the best ways to synthesize knowledge. It helps retain knowledge and deepens it as you continuously challenge your previous assumptions while writing.

# Freedom
I recently discovered that Medium [has ended](https://medium.com/thought-thinkers/the-end-to-free-non-member-reads-on-medium-da4b8d63c1fe) free non-member reads to its articles. X is also [experimenting](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/18/x-twitter-1-dollar-annual-subscription-fee-new-users-elon-musk-new-zealand-nz-philippines) with paid access. In this environment, I want to be independent of any of the big content providers. Therefore, I decided to host my custom Jekyll website behind the domain I own.
